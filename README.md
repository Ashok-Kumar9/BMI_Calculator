# BMI Calculator ðŸ’ª

## Goal

The objective of making this app is to customise Flutter Widgets in order to achieve beautiful user interface designs. We can create any design with the help of flutter.

## What we will create

Weâ€™re going to make a Body Mass Index Calculator inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Ruben Vaalt](https://dribbble.com/shots/4585382-Simple-BMI-Calculator). It will be a multi screen app with simple functionality but full-on custom styling.
